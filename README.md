## About me

I am someone who loves understanding new concepts and consistently improving my skills, so I decided to go into web development as a career path! After graduating from the web development bootcamp at Le Wagon London, I now have a foundation in full stack web development using Ruby on Rails as a framework.

## Interests

I have a passion for anything related to tech and have a desire to understand the latest trends in the space. I also love animals, nature and fitness.
