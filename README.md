## About me

I am relatively new to the world of web development. Because I am someone who loves understanding new concepts and consistently improving my skills, I decided to go into web development as a career path! After graduating from the web development bootcamp at Le Wagon London, I now have a foundation in full stack web development using Ruby on Rails as a framework. I look forward to sharpening my current skills and learning new technologies!

## Interests

I have a passion for anything related to tech and have a desire to understand the latest trends in the space. I also love animals, nature and fitness!
